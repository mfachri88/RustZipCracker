# Rust ZIP Cracker v3.5

A fast, accurate, and feature-rich brute-force password cracking tool for ZIP archives, written in Rust. This tool is designed to maximize multi-core CPU utilization, ensure memory safety, and keep resource usage minimal.


## Description

This project aims to provide a reliable security auditing tool to test the strength of passwords on ZIP archives. It is perfect for research and educational purposes within a controlled lab environment. The design combines high performance of an efficient engine, memory safety and concurrency of Rust, and the convenience of a mature command-line application.

This release has specifically fixed all logical bugs, including false positives and handling of non-standard ZIP file types, to ensure absolute accuracy.

## Key Features

* üöÄ **Concurrent & Fast:** Uses Rust native threads to run password attempts in parallel, leveraging all available CPU cores.
* üß† **Memory-Efficient:** Streams the wordlist line by line using `BufReader`, allowing it to handle wordlists dozens of gigabytes in size without consuming excessive RAM.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Reliable & Accurate Logic:** No longer relies on unreliable metadata. The cracking logic fundamentally tests each password against every file inside the archive to guarantee no false positives.
* ‚ú® **Professional Interface:** Built with `clap` for advanced command-line argument parsing and `indicatif` for a real-time, informative progress bar.
* üõë **Graceful Shutdown:** Uses `ctrlc` to capture Ctrl+C signals, ensuring the program can stop cleanly, save progress, and display a final report without corrupting the terminal output.
* üìÇ **Automatic Extraction:** If a password is found, the tool can automatically extract the ZIP contents to a directory specified with the `-o` flag.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Rust and Cargo: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Git

You can install and run this tool in two ways:

### 1. From Source (Recommended)

This method is best if you want to modify or manually build the project.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (replace URL with your repo URL)
git clone https://github.com/mfachri88/RustZipCracker.git

# 2. Change into the project directory
cd RustZipCracker

# 3. Build the optimized release executable
cargo build --release
```

After building, the high-performance executable will be available at `target/release/rust_zip_cracker`.

### 2. Via `cargo install`

This method installs the binary directly from the Git repository and makes it available as a terminal command.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/mfachri88/RustZipCracker.git
```

## Usage

Run the tool from the project‚Äôs root directory:

```bash
# Run the built executable
target/release/rust_zip_cracker -f <file.zip> -w <wordlist.txt> [other_options]

# Or run without separate build
tools/run.sh -f <file.zip> -w <wordlist.txt> [other_options]
```

> **Note:** Use `--` after `--release` when running with Cargo to ensure arguments are passed to the tool, not to Cargo itself.

## Command-Line Flags

| Flag | Type     | Description                                            | Required |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `-f` | `string` | Path to the ZIP file to crack.                         | Yes      |
| `-w` | `string` | Path to the wordlist file containing passwords.        | Yes      |
| `-o` | `string` | Output directory for extracted files.                  | No       |
| `-t` | `int`    | Number of threads/workers to use (default: CPU cores). | No       |

## Examples

### 1. Basic Usage

Attempt to find the password with default settings:

```bash
./target/release/rust_zip_cracker -f secret-archive.zip -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### 2. Using 16 Threads

Maximize CPU utilization by setting 16 workers:

```bash
./target/release/rust_zip_cracker -f project.zip -w passwords.txt -t 16
```

*Output:*

```
[===>     ] 10% | 1,434,439/14,344,393 | 15,023 pwd/s
```

### 3. Crack & Extract in One Step

Crack and automatically extract contents to `extracted_output` directory:

```bash
./target/release/rust_zip_cracker -f important.zip -w rockyou.txt -o extracted_output
```
